# Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a model where we predict the value of an independent variable using the values of a dependent variable. Linear regression model is best describd using the linear equation of a line Y= mX+c."Y" is the dependent variable, "X" is the independent variable, "c" signifies the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero. "m" is the slope of the line describing, how much strong is the relation between "X" and "Y". That is what is the iuncrease in "Y"(dependent variable) with the increase in "X"(independent variable).

Among the multiple lines passing through the scattered data, we need to find the best fit line. The best-fit line is obtained by minimising a quantity called Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).
